# AI-Job-Market-Trends
- Analyzed the AI job market for Data Analyst vs Data Scientist roles using a Kaggle dataset (Sep 2023–Sep 2025) to support job-seeker decision making (salary benchmarks, skill priorities, target companies/locations, and application timing).
- Performed data cleaning and feature engineering (role/experience normalization, posted-date to monthly period) and built metrics for job-posting trends including a 3-month moving average.
- Conducted salary analysis by role and experience level (median, P10–P90) and estimated 95% bootstrap confidence intervals to quantify uncertainty.
- Ran an inferential test (two-proportion z-test) to compare the share of high-salary postings between Data Scientist and Data Analyst roles.
- Built and published an interactive Tableau Public dashboard with filters (role, experience level, time window, Top-N) covering job trends, top companies/countries, salary by experience, and top skills demand.
