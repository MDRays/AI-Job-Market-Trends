Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abhishekjaiswal4896/ai-job-market-trends/data

## **Project Overview**
This project provides a data-driven analysis of the global AI job market, specifically comparing **Data Analyst** and **Data Scientist** roles. Utilizing a comprehensive Kaggle dataset (September 2023 – September 2025), I aimed to provide actionable insights for job seekers regarding salary benchmarks, required skills, and optimal application timing.

## **Key Objectives**
* **Identify** salary disparities and trends between Data Analyst and Data Scientist roles across different experience levels.
* **Perform** statistical hypothesis testing to validate market assumptions regarding pay and demand.
* **Analyze** the geographic distribution of AI jobs and identify top hiring companies.
* **Visualize** complex market trends through an interactive and user-friendly dashboard.

## **Technology Stack**
* **Language**: Python.
* **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy (Data Manipulation), SciPy & Statsmodels (Statistical Analysis), Matplotlib (Static Visualization).
* **Visualization**: Tableau Public.
* **Documentation**: PowerPoint.

## **Analysis Workflow**

### **1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
* Cleaned and pre-processed the raw Kaggle dataset to ensure consistency in job titles and salary denominations.
* Handled missing values and standardized categorical data for more accurate grouping.

### **2. Statistical Analysis**
* Applied **Inferential Statistics** to compare salary means across different regions and job levels.
* Used **SciPy/Statsmodels** to conduct hypothesis testing, ensuring that the insights derived were statistically significant rather than mere coincidences.

### **3. Dashboard Design (Tableau)**
* Developed an interactive dashboard on **Tableau Public** featuring:
    * **Job Trends**: Monitoring the rise and fall of AI job postings over time.
    * **Salary Analysis**: Filters for experience level, location, and specific job titles.
    * **Skills Demand**: Visualizing the most sought-after tools and frameworks in the industry.
    * **Geographic Mapping**: Highlighting target countries and companies with the highest demand.

## **Key Insights for Job Seekers**
* **Salary Benchmarks**: Provided clear expectations for entry-level vs. senior-level roles in the AI space.
* **Skill Prioritization**: Identified which technical skills lead to higher marketability in current trends.
* **Targeting Strategy**: Mapped out top-tier locations and companies to help candidates focus their application efforts.
